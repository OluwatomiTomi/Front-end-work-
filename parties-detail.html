             <b class="text-primary"> Plans: </b><br><br>
             This is my plan that will:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>  give Nigerian workers a living wage</li>
             <li> empower Nigerian women, reduce maternal mortality and increase their financial stability</li>
              <li>cater for the elderly, so our people are not afraid of growing old
    invest in our failing power, water and roads</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
          But above all, this is a plan that will help create jobs because in my many travels across our great nation the one consistent thing I hear wherever I am is that our people need jobs.
